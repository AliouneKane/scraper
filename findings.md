# Findings & Research

## Discoveries
- **Ben's Bytes Archive:** `https://bensbites.substack.com/archive` (Substack based).
- **The AI Rundown Archive:** `https://www.therundown.ai/archive` (Custom site, Beehiiv based).
- **Reddit Subreddits:** `r/MachineLearning`, `r/ArtificialIntelligence`, `r/learnmachinelearning`, `r/LocalLLaMA`.

## Constraints
- Newsletter content is often behind a "Read more" or requires clicking into individual articles from the archive.
- Reddit requires either PRAW (API) or scraping (risk of blocks). PRAW is preferred for reliability.
- 24h update cycle requires timestamps from the source.
